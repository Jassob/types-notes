Notes taken during the Chalmers course Types for Programs and Proofs.
They are written during the lectures and not edited afterwards so they
are quite messy.  Most of the proofs are missing but I tried to write
down any important or unintuitive step in proofs.

The notes are hosted on 
[github](https://github.com/karljakoblarsson/types-notes
"karljakoblarsson/types-notes").
Please improve them and send a pull request!

As you cans see lecture 4 appears two times but the content is
different. Something is wrong but hopefully most of the content is
there.
