Notes taken during the Chalmers course Types for Programs and Proofs.
They are quite messy and are lacking most of the proofs. I tried to
write down any important or unintuitive step in proofs.

The notes are stored on 
[github](https://github.com/karljakoblarsson/types-notes
"karljakoblarsson/types-notes").
Please improve them and send a pull request!
